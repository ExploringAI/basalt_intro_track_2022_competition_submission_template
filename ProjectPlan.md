# Multiple Neural Networks
Training multiple neural networks separately to solve specific questions, and combine them together as an agent to control player.
## Task processing unit
Complete tasks generated by Task generating unit.
### Imagine recognition (_Dennis_)
Perceive images and build a 3D environment model around player.

&emsp;

param obs: The 640x320x3 picture of minecraft real-time game screen

type obs: Dict(pov:Box(low=0, high=255, shape=(360, 640, 3)))

param pitch: The pitch of camera in degree, -90<=pitch<=90

type pitch: numpy.float32

param yaw: The yaw of camera in degree, 0<=yaw<=360

type yaw: numpy.float32

returns env: A 3D environment model perceived from an image (int represent type of block, three dimension, a relative coordinate system with the player as the origin)

rtype env: numpy.ndarray

returns player_info: Information about the player, such as hunger and knapsack items

rtype player_info: dict
### Motion processing (_Thaumstrial_)
Control the player to go to a specific location.

&emsp;

param pos: A target position contains x, y, and z

type pos: triple

returns act: instructions to move

rtype act: dict

### Action processing (_ExploringAI_)
Complete instructions that require the agent to take action.
method: supervised learning of a 2d network
input: Image Recognition
return: tasks (goto (block), break (block), place (block), craft (item))

## GOTO Routing
A agent routing throu stuff to e.g. find diamonds
input: block
return: (goto (relative xyz), break (block), place (block))

## Task generating unit
Tasks are proposed by neural networks.
### Planning task
Plan the entire player behavior, such as mine diamond or explore tunnel.
### Information filtering(finished later)
Filtering out redundant information makes the whole network more focused
